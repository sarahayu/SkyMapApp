                    <p>Our goal was to be able to render to the OLED what stars would be visible in the sky depending on
                        the orientation of a Texas Instrument launchpad. This involved creating a backend API to do the
                        calculation of what stars would be visible given an orientation (azimuth, altitude, roll),
                        viewport, and time, and return a list of screen coordinates of the stars and constellations. In
                        addition, it involved configuring additional sensors to the launchpad, namely a gyroscope, which
                        is not available on-board, to get the correct orientation of the board.

        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <h3>Gyroscope and Accelerometer</h3>
        <p>The application used Invensense‚Äôs MPU 6050 to understand the device‚Äôs orientation in space. This sensor
            package includes a 3-axis accelerometer, a 3-axis gyroscope, and a digital motion processor (DMP). The
            accelerometers provided an accurate vector for gravity, from which the altitude and roll can easily be
            derived. The DMP continuously samples the sensors, calculates the rotation from the initial position, and
            returns this information as a quaternion. This can be used to get the azimuth. While the quaternion could be
            used to get the complete orientation, the accuracy of the gyroscope was very low, which meant that
            integration error added up quickly. It was more reliable to use the raw accelerometer data for altitude and
            roll.
        </p>
        <p>Communication with the sensor was done over an I2C bus. The accelerometer data can be read directly from the
            sensor registers. The DMP periodically places its data into a FIFO which can be read from in bursts. Each
            data packet is 42 bytes and consists of 4 floats for the quaternion, 3 32-bit integers for the gyroscope
            data, 3 32-bit integers for the accelerometer data, and two bytes of garbage.
        </p>
        <h3>IR Receiver</h3>
        <p>To receive user input from an IR remote, the Vishay TSOP31336 IR receiver was used. The output of the module
            was sent to a GPIO pin configured with a falling edge interrupt. The systick timer was used to measure the
            time between falling edges and then interpret the incoming data.
        </p>
        <h3>API Backend</h3>
        <p>We could not find an online API that achieved our specific purposes, so we decided to write our own using
            Python and Flask. Luckily, there was a Python library we found named Skyfield that greatly simplified
            fetching required star/constellation databases and calculating star positions in the sky at a given point in
            time. From there, we coded a Flask backend that accepted POST requests containing viewport data like
            azimuth, altitude, roll, and FOV, as well as time data stating how many minutes from current epoch the user
            would like to fetch star data for. Then, using Skyfield, we returned a CSV string with data about the stars
            and constellation lines in screen space coordinates.

        <h2>Bugs and known issues üêû</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Gyroscope accuracy:</b> The accuracy of the gyroscope is not very good and the integration error adds
                up quickly. This can be resolved by a better sensor.</li>
            <li><b>I2C bus error:</b> Sometimes, if the launchpad is reset while the I2C bus is transmitting, the module
                goes into an unrecoverable state and the launchpad must be power-cycled to restore functionality.</li>
            <li><b>HTTP backlog:</b> Despite the functions returning success every time, the HTTP responses would
                occasionally backlog. This caused the stars that were being shown on the OLED to be from two or three
                frames before. Then, on the next frame draw, it would render star information that was supposed to be
                shown in the previous frame, and etc.</li>
            <li><b>Wifi module timeout:</b> After 2-3 minutes of continuous runtime, the wifi module suddenly stops
                responding and the program freezes. The cause of this is unknown but resetting the device resolves it.
            </li>
        </ul>
